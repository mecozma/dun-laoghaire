          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Dún Laoghaire[15] (/dʌn ˈlɪəri/ dun LEER-ee, Irish: [d̪ˠuːn̪ˠ
            ˈl̪ˠeːɾʲə] or [d̪ˠuːn̪ˠ ˈl̪ˠiːɾʲə]) is a suburban coastal town in the
            traditional county of Dublin in Ireland. It is the county town of
            Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, one of the three authorities that replaced
            the old Dublin County Council.
          </p>
          <p>
            The town was built following the 1816 legislation that allowed the
            building of a major port to serve Dublin. It was known as Dunleary
            until it was renamed Kingstown in honour of King George IV's 1821
            visit, and in 1920 was given its present name, the original Irish
            form of Dunleary. Over time, the town became a residential location,
            a seaside resort and the terminus of Ireland's first railway.
          </p>
          <h2>Sports</h2>
          <h3>Boating</h3>
          <p>
            Dún Laoghaire harbour is home to a number of yacht clubs including
            the Dún Laoghaire Motor Yacht Club with premises on the West Pier,
            the Irish National Sailing School & Club based at the foot of the
            West Pier, the Sailing in Dublin Club with premises in the Coal
            Harbour, the Royal Irish Yacht Club between the Commissioners for
            Irish Lights and the marina entrance, the Royal St George Yacht Club
            opposite the Pavilion Centre, National Yacht Club closest to the
            East Pier and the Irish Youth Sailing Club which is run by the Dún
            Laoghaire Coast Guard Kyron O'Gorman and located on the East Pier.
          </p>
          <h3>Golf</h3>
          <p>
            The town had a golf club from 1909 to 2007, but its members agreed
            to sell the course to housing developers and move to Ballyman Road,
            near Enniskerry in County Wicklow.
          </p>
          <h2>Tourism</h2>
          <p>
            Much of the town's early growth came from visitors from Dublin, and
            today there is one large hotel, heavily refurbished in 2007, the
            Royal Marine, along with several small hotels, and a number of
            bed-and-breakfasts.
          </p>
          <h3>Pier Walking</h3>
          <p>
            Walking the East Pier of Dún Laoghaire Harbour is the most popular
            tourism activity in Dún Laoghaire. The west pier is longer but the
            surface of the pier is less suitable for walking.
          </p>
          <h3>Cruise ship visits</h3>
          <p>
            In 2011, Dún Laoghaire Harbour published a master plan, which
            focused on developing Dún Laoghaire as a tourist destination.
            Specifically, the plan revolved around promoting Dún Laoghaire
            Harbour as a prime location for both ferries and cruise ships. Since
            then, many cruise ships have stopped in Dún Laoghaire, usually
            between the months of May and July. The first ship to arrive was the
            Cunard liner RMS Queen Mary 2 on 16 May, and P&O's MV Arcadia
            arrived on 9 July. The Queen Mary 2 was the 7th largest cruise ship
            in the world at the time, with a maximum passenger capacity of about
            3,000. Other large vessels to visit Dun Laoghaire include the QE2
            and the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy.
          </p>
          <h3>Outdoor tourism</h3>
          <p>
            In July 2013, the first-ever tourism office opened in Dún Laoghaire.
            Kayaking, kite surfing, paddle boarding and sailing are available,
            along with facilities for biking and rock climbing.
